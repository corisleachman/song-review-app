# Song Room launch checklist

Last reconciled: 1 November 2026. This is the current progress page. Keep this URL in every completion update so we can always see what's left.

## Where we are

Public beta is live. Five foundation stages are done. Security closeout is in progress, followed by launch QA, discoverability closeout and the wider-launch decision. Stage counts describe scope, not a percentage of engineering effort.

| Stage | Status | What it covers | Evidence or exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0. One current plan | Done | Reconcile roadmap, release notes and backlog; establish this page and update rules | Reconciliation recorded on 1 November; older plans explicitly marked historical |
| L1. Public account foundation | Done | Google sign-in, canonical profiles, workspaces, membership and invites | Existing production releases; [rollout history](public-mvp-roadmap.md) |
| L2. Collaboration, plans and sharing | Done | Song/version feedback, uploads, playback, Free/Pro/Studio billing, public playlists and playlist embeds | Production rollout history; playback acceptance in [release log](UPDATE_LOG.md) |
| L3. Public email login and recovery | Done | Signup, confirmation, password login, recovery/reset alongside Google | Controlled production journey passed 25 October; [auth completion record](EMAIL_PASSWORD_STAGING_ROLLOUT.md#current-status-1-november-2026) |
| L4. Homepage readiness | Done | Clear login, repaired links, responsive presentation, local assets and initial-load improvements | PRs [53](https://github.com/corisleachman/song-review-app/pull/53), [61](https://github.com/corisleachman/song-review-app/pull/61), [62](https://github.com/corisleachman/song-review-app/pull/62); performance follow-up [63](https://github.com/corisleachman/song-review-app/pull/63) merged 31 October; final measurements belong to L6 |
| L5. Security closeout | In progress | Access boundaries, database warnings, abuse protection, validation, secrets and monitoring | Initial live inventory complete; remaining checks below must be resolved or explicitly accepted |
| L6. Performance and final launch QA | Not started | Dashboard loading/return and song-navigation performance work, then consolidated journey, browser/device, accessibility, links and payment sandbox checks | Recorded pass/fail matrix; no unresolved launch-blocking defects |
| L7. Discoverability closeout | Not started | Verify shipped SEO baseline, canonical host, alt text, FAQ scope and pending article | Production metadata/link checks and content decisions recorded; sitemap, robots and trust page already shipped |
| L8. Wider-launch decision | Not started | Review evidence, remaining risks, rollback and support readiness | L5-L7 complete; user records go/no-go for wider promotion |

Done means the named scope has recorded evidence, not that every future improvement in that area is finished. Later findings reopen the relevant stage. L8 does not authorise a marketing campaign or messages to others.

## Current stage: L5 security closeout

| ID | Check | Status | Evidence / next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | Establish current security baseline | Done | Read-only production inventory: RLS on all 24 public tables; advisor has zero ERROR findings, five WARN findings and eight INFO findings. [Review record](LAUNCH_SECURITY_REVIEW.md) | Agent |
| S2 | Cross-workspace API and direct-database access | In progress | Canonical identity, thread path and eight dashboard/song/admin/internal route samples inspected; 42 local handler tests pass; B21 is installed on staging: 34 installed-definition SQL checks, six invitation checks and scoped browser checks pass. Production repair verified; broader API coverage remains. [Inventory of all 68 API route files](LAUNCH_API_ACCESS_MATRIX.md) created; exercise owner/member/outsider/public boundaries on staging. RLS enabled alone isn't a pass | Agent |
| S3 | Database function and policy review | In progress | Five search-path fixes and B21 migration installed on staging; zero staging security errors/warnings; 40 SQL checks and browser checks pass. [Review package](https://github.com/corisleachman/song-review-app/pull/67). Production repair verified; no public views in either environment. B23 confirms private staging audio is anonymously retrievable from public Storage; repair/revocation decision open | Agent |
| S4 | Abuse protection coverage | In progress | Email login limiter, Turnstile and feedback throttle exist. Invite/comment/bootstrap coverage still needs explicit decisions and tests | Agent |
| S5 | Input validation and safe errors | Not started | Audit mutation inputs, size/type limits, numeric bounds and error responses. Upload validation already has regression coverage | Agent |
| S6 | Secret handling and log safety | Not started | Recheck variable classification/scopes without exposing values; inventory logging and confirm redaction. Earlier Config-vs-Secret concern is unverified, not a proven leak | Agent |
| S7 | Monitoring, dependency and CI closeout | Not started | Production dependency audit: four low, zero moderate/high/critical advisories. Confirm alerts/retention; review open PRs and missing audit workflow | Agent |

Performance is the user's main MVP concern. B17-B19 are queued as the leading L6 workstream; capture does not interrupt the current L5 task. B06 six-month Free-to-Pro beta grants have confirmed product rules; implementation and expiry/billing boundary tests remain open.

Next action: resolve B23 media revocation requirements and prepare compatible authorised media delivery before any private-bucket cutover. Continue remaining S2 access checks alongside it. B21 and the five function search-path fixes are Production complete; the broader security stage remains open.

## L6 acceptance checklist

| Check | Status | Successful result / stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google and Email signup/login/recovery | Not started for consolidated pass | Existing users retain their identities and workspaces; stop for duplicate account, wrong-host mail or lost recovery |
| Invites and workspace separation | Not started for consolidated pass | Only intended membership changes; another workspace's private data remains inaccessible |
| Upload, first Play, seeking, commenting, restart, repeat and version changes | Not started for consolidated pass | Supported files work; no competing audio or wrong-version feedback; include phone background/lock screen |
| Free/paid limits, upgrade, checkout, cancellation and webhook reconciliation | Not started for consolidated pass | Use isolated Stripe test environment; correct plan/interval and preserved data; no live payment required |
| Forms, feedback, public sharing and embed revocation | Not started for consolidated pass | Clear validation; private material stays private; revocation removes public access |
| Accessibility and desktop/phone/tablet coverage | Not started for consolidated pass | Keyboard/focus/dialog checks, readable layouts and no overflow; physical 11-inch iPad remains additional coverage |
| Link crawl and SEO endpoints | Not started for consolidated pass | Intended internal links resolve; protected routes stay protected |
| Production performance after PR #63 | Not started | Repeat named mobile/desktop measurements; distinguish lab runs from field data; inspect LCP, CLS and transferred bytes |

Run local checks before staging journeys, then safe production smoke checks. Stop the affected rollout on failure and record environment, URL, step, expected/actual result, safe error/log excerpt and screenshot where useful. Never attach credentials or full auth links.

## Backlog and MVP requirements

Every new request gets a row here with a stable ID, status and stage assignment (or Later). Detail can stay in [PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md). Adding a request doesn't silently make it a launch blocker.

| ID | Item | Status | Stage / priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B01 | Signed-in Account security: Add/Change password | Gated off; core recovery works | Separate auth release; explicit activation approval and verification required |
| B02 | Google return shows repeated loading experiences | Needs measurement | Later, P2 UX |
| B03 | Embed individual publicly shared songs | Not started; plan/access decision required | Later, P2 sharing; playlist embeds already done |
| B04 | Contextual upgrade prompts and durable funnel events | Foundation partly exists; event work pending | Review beta minimum during L6; automation later |

| B19 | [Dashboard-to-song navigation speed](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md#b19-dashboard-to-song-measure-and-reduce-navigation-delay) | User report; baseline pending | L6 performance; canonical access must remain intact |
| B20 | [New-version collaboration notifications](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md#b20-verify-notifications-for-new-version-uploads) | All-workspace-member delivery confirmed; capability/delivery untested | L6 dependability audit; no new channel assumed |
| B21 | [Membership RLS recursion](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md#b21-membership-rls-recursively-evaluates-itself) | Production complete; staging and live checks pass | L5/S2-S3, P1 |
| B23 | [Private media public Storage access](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md#b23-private-song-media-remains-accessible-through-permanent-public-storage-urls) | Confirmed staging audio HEAD 200 without auth; same Production public-bucket configuration; repair/revocation decision pending | L5/S2-S3, P1 privacy |
| B22 | [Unconfigured legacy password false success](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md#b22-legacy-password-verifier-reports-success-when-unconfigured) | Production complete via PR #66; 121 tests and eight live smoke checks pass | L5/S2, P2 |

Exploratory ideas in ROADMAP.md (typing indicators, pinned comments, comparison view, waveform regions, exports, Slack, native mobile app, multitrack and video) remain unscheduled ideas. They aren't approved launch work. Delete/edit/auth/invite ideas in that old file must be checked against existing features before creating tasks.

## Keeping this page current

- Update this page in the same change as a completed stage or backlog item. Include implementation status separately from rollout status, dated evidence and any remaining limit.
- Include a link to this page in every completed-action reply. Use the same current page; add a dated checkpoint below so progress history remains visible.
- Add every new backlog request to the table above and its detailed record. Assign a stage or Later, owner where known, and a clear next action. Keep Done rows visible.
- Never replace evidence with a tick. A local pass, merged PR and verified production release are different states.
- Keep detailed security findings in repository review records. Don't publish this planning page as a new unauthenticated application route.

## Source precedence

This page controls current priorities and stage status. PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md retains task detail; EMAIL_PASSWORD_STAGING_ROLLOUT.md and UPDATE_LOG.md retain dated release evidence. public-mvp-roadmap.md is historical phase planning. ROADMAP.md is an early ideas/implementation guide. When evidence conflicts, investigate and correct the current table instead of copying an old status forward.
